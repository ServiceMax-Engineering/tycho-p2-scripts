=== Tycho and p2 release scripts ===
This project contains various scripts useful when building p2-repositories with tycho
or generating composite repositories.

These scripts are dual licensed EPL-1.0 and Apache-2.0

== tycho-release.sh ==
This script can be used to tag a maven-tycho build and to deploy the generated p2 repositories.
It assumes a unix environment. It requires bash and the XML:XPath perl module.

== Generate Composite Repository ==
This script generates a p2 composite repository: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Composite_Repositories_(new)
It requires ruby.

It reads the file passed as an argument: --otherurls
Each line of this file is parsed in the order that they are written:
* If the first character is '#' or if the line is blanked; the line is ignored.
* If the line contains '://' then it is assumed that the line is an absolute URL to a p2-repository. The url is appended to the children repositories
* If the line starts with BASE= it defines a new value for the current folder from which relative paths on the file system are resolved.
For example: BASE=~/p2repo/org/intalio
* If the line starts with a '/' or '~' it is assumed to be an absolute path on the file system.
* The other types of lines are assumed to be relative paths and are computed relative to the BASE directory
They can contain a glob expression for the last segment.

For each line a single repository is appended. When the line contains a glob expression, the latest version of the folders name selected is used.

An html page is generated to describe the contents of the composite repository.

The project's comes with a sample directory structure to experiment with.
