=== Tycho and p2 release scripts ===
This project contains various scripts useful when building p2-repositories with tycho
or generating composite repositories.

These scripts are dual licensed EPL-1.0 and Apache-2.0

== tycho-release.sh ==
This script can be used to tag a maven-tycho build and to deploy the generated p2 repositories.
It assumes a unix environment. It requires bash and the XML:XPath perl module.

== Generate Composite Repository ==
This script generates a p2 composite repository: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Composite_Repositories_(new)
It requires ruby.

It traverses the file system looking for $repo-name.composite.mkrepo files.
Whenever it finds one it looks at the versionned repository inside that folder, chooses the latest one
and add it to the collection of children repositories.

An html page is generated to describe the contents of the composite repository.

The project's comes with a sample directory structure to experiment with.
